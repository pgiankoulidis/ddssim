    "The sizing parameters of the model are the size of the sketch $D$ and $L$, the number of local sites $k$, and the local threshold $\\theta$. From the AGMS paper, a sketch of dimensions $D\\times L$ can answer queries with accuracy $\\epsilon = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{L}}$, with probability at least $1-2^{-D/2}$.\n",

    "With respect to $L=\\frac{4}{\\epsilon^2}$ and $\\theta$, we have a trade-off, for any given $\\beta$. We can choose a value for $\\epsilon \\in (0, \\beta)$, and compute a matching $\\theta$.\n",

    "A good rule of the thumb, derived experimentally, seems to be to choose $\\epsilon = \\beta/2$. Whatever the choice for $\\epsilon$ is, we can the proceed as follows:\n",

    "Now, the task is to monitor the query approximately, so that the overall error is at most $\\beta$. To this effect, we will wish to create a safe zone for the sketch query $Q(t)$.
